.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a simple UNIX command line interpreter that reads commands from either standard input or a file and executes them.
.PP
.B hsh
is a basic implementation of a shell that replicates some core functionality of the standard UNIX shell
.BR /bin/sh .
It supports both interactive and non-interactive usage.
.SH INVOCATION
.B hsh
can be invoked interactively or non-interactively.
.PP
If standard input is not connected to a terminal,
.B hsh
reads and executes commands in sequence.
.PP
If standard input is connected to a terminal (as determined by
.BR isatty (3)),
.B hsh
runs in interactive mode and displays the prompt
.B $
when ready to accept commands.
.SH COMMAND EXECUTION
After receiving a command,
.B hsh
tokenizes it using a space character as a delimiter. The first token is treated as the command and the remaining tokens as arguments.
.PP
.B hsh
executes commands in the following order:
.IP 1. 3
If the command is a built-in command (see
.B BUILT-IN COMMANDS
below), it is executed directly.
.IP 2.
If the command begins with a slash (/) or dot (.),
.B hsh
executes it using the specified path.
.IP 3.
If the command contains no slash,
.B hsh
searches for it in the directories listed in the
.B PATH
environment variable.
.IP 4.
If the command cannot be found,
.B hsh
prints an error message and returns to the prompt.
.SH BUILT-IN COMMANDS
The following built-in commands are supported:
.TP
.B exit
Exit the shell with the status of the last executed command.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables.
.SH EXIT STATUS
.B hsh
returns the exit status of the last executed command.
.IP 0

.IP 1
General errors
.IP 2

.IP 127
